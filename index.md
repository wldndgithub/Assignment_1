### My Background
I'm a Korean living in Australia for pretty much all my life, moving states from NSW to VIC.
I'm fluent in korean and english, and have done japanese in highschool. my highest form of education is VCE and have wasted my time ever since. But now I have decided to gather my s#$t and become a better person through education.
I currently work as barista at Starbucks in which I throughly enjoy, but not as much as my passion for gaming (reason for my wasted years).

### Interest in IT
My interest in IT was sparked by a close friend who told me if I was going to spend hours infront of my PC then I may as well look into the IT field which I can use the PC to my hearts content. After hearing this I decided to study IT as nothing else excites me (in terms of study).
I've chosen RMIT's OUA course as I currently work full time for starbucks (due to financial reasons) leaving me unable to attend university beacause of my time constraints.
Through this course I expect to learn all that I need to learn to find myself in the IT field. maybe in the gaming side of things.

### Ideal Job
Although I'm not too sure about what path I will persue in the IT industry but something with a balance between technical and human to human interaction.
To me an ideal job would be one such as a [Lead program manager](https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings/oKvo9fww).
 A job that requires knowledge of the technical things and experience in people management hopefully in a game development company such eg. Blizzard Ent. This kind of job would require:
- Bachelor's degree in relevant field (IT, project management)
- Experience and knowledge in games, program development
- Skills in project and performance management

### Personal Profile
- Myers-Briggs test: “THE DEFENDER” (ISFJ-A)

- Learning style test: Visual Learner
- Creativity test:
![creativity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wldndgithub/Assignment_1/master/creativity.PNG)
I'm a "defender" in a workplace, which means that I seek frictionless relationships by supporting and helping others in order to get the work done. A true team player.
Learning best visually, I benefit greatly with images, graphs, etc as I may somtimes lack the creativity to see things beyond the surface. I would probably work well with anyone that becomes my team as I excell in human connections and have great work ethics.

### Project Idea

##### Overview
The creation of a program that renders events and persons in the Bible, allowing for a visual and interactive representation in order to aid the learning of the Bible.

##### Motivation
As a faithful christian and an avid gamer that enjoys open world games for it's beautiful and immersivee nvironment, it has always been a wish to have high quality educative material that takes advantage of modern technology.

##### Description
An interactive learning tool that illustrates the events of the Bible. The application would be much like an open world game that renders vast enironments eg. Assassin's Creed franchise, but without the fantasy aspect instead having a huge focus on historic accuracy.
Much like a RPG game the user would take control of a character, which is able to traverse the world of the Bible from the Moab mountain ranges(now Jordan) to the exotic river Nile of Egypt and many other historic places. Filled with interactive "spots" scattered through out the world, which can be things such as dialogue of NPC/s(non-player character), vantage points and replicas of artifacts and architecture. These "spots" when interacted with will use artifacts, historic documents and quotations from the Bible to carefully explain the background stories, interesting facts and anything else that may be of significance.
 
An example of whatthe application would do is: showing the historic setting of "Battle of David and Goliath", having comparisons of Goliaths height to relatable people(eg. Shaquille O'neal), weapons that were used in the battle and experience the battle unfold in 3rd person view as the player.

##### Tools and Technologies
A game engine(eg. Anvil) will be suitable for this application which will serve as a development platform/environment that brings rendering engine, audio engine, physics engine and AI components in order to create the rich and immersive world to life.

##### Skills Required
A multitude of skills are required for such a strenuous project. Software development, audio engineering, animating and art creation, testing and quality assureance, scriptwriting, and indepth knowledge of the Bible and its events are the broad fields of expertise that would be required. Realisticly speaking it is impossible afford and make such expensive application but the tools and people who can help create such program exist

##### Outcome
The creation of this application will serve as a great tool for people teaching the Bible as it provides and interactive and immersive world that shows and educate the Bible's events and settings in a fun and enjoyable way. This will help educate and spark the dropping interest of the younger generation of christians which experience modern technology from a very young age.
