### My Background
I'm a Korean living in Australia for pretty much all my life, moving states from NSW to VIC.
I'm fluent in korean and english, and have done japanese in highschool. my highest form of education is VCE and have wasted my time ever since. But now I have decided to gather my s#$t and become a better person through education.
I currently work as barista at Starbucks in which I throughly enjoy, but not as much as my passion for gaming (reason for my wasted years).
