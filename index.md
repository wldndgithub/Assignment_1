### My Background
I'm a Korean living in Australia for pretty much all my life, moving states from NSW to VIC.
I'm fluent in korean and english, and have done japanese in highschool. my highest form of education is VCE and have wasted my time ever since. But now I have decided to gather my s#$t and become a better person through education.
I currently work as barista at Starbucks in which I throughly enjoy, but not as much as my passion for gaming (reason for my wasted years).

### Interest in IT
My interest in IT was sparked by a close friend who told me if I was going to spend hours infront of my PC then I may as well look into the IT field which I can use the PC to my hearts content. After hearing this I decided to study IT as nothing else excites me (in terms of study).
I've chosen RMIT's OUA course as I currently work full time for starbucks (due to financial reasons) leaving me unable to attend university beacause of my time constraints.
Through this course I expect to learn all that I need to learn to find myself in the IT field. maybe in the gaming side of things.+

### Ideal Job
Although I'm not too sure about what path I will persue in the IT industry but something with a balance between technical and human to human interaction.
To me an ideal job would be one such as this: [Lead program manager](https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings/oKvo9fww).
A job that requires knowledge of the technical things and experience in people management hopefully in a game development company such eg. Blizzard Ent. This kind of job would require:
- Bachelor's degree in relevant field (IT, project management)
- Experience and knowledge in games, program development
- Skills in project and performance management

### Personal Profile
- Myers-Briggs test: “THE DEFENDER” (ISFJ-A)

- Visual Learner
- Creativity
![creativity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wldndgithub/Assignment_1/master/creativity.PNG)
I'm a "defender" in a workplace, meaning I seek frictionless relationships, supporting and helping others in order to get the work done.
Learning best visually, I benefit greatly with images, graphs, etc as I may somtimes lack the creativity to see things beyond the surface. I would probably work well with anyone that becomes my team as I excell in human connections and great work ethics.

### Project Idea

#### Overview
The creation of a program that renders events and persons in the Bible, allowing for a visual and interactive representation in order to aid the learning of the Bible.
